Eurodomest (Shenzen) BLE RGB Led Bulb

The device is using a simple protocol
over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection.
Messages are 20 characters long and can be
divided into 5 groups. These are basically the
state and dimlevels of the different leds.

Example:

MSG = GREEN HEAD BLUE RED  WHITE
MSG =  01ff 0100 0000 01ff 0000

The first 2 bytes of every color-groups are the
state switches, 00 means off, while 01 means on.
Afterwards comes the dimlevel in hex format, from
00 to ff which is 256 steps. Only exception is the
header group, what is possibly the global flag and
another which has been used by turning on and off.
